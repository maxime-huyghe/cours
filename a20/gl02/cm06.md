# Cooperative software development

Séquentialisation, parallélisation, historique, nouveau contributeurs...

# CVSs

manage :

- code
- design documents
- test data sets
- user manual
- license
- ...

Git, Mercurial, SVN...

Production line metaphor :

- Baseline = reference version(s)
- Codeline = specific production line at team or dev scale

# Working with SVN

opérations de check-out et check-in (commit)

```shell
svn checkout <repo-url>
svn commit -m 'commit message'

svn copy <URI_distant_repo/trunk> <URI_distant_repo/branch>
svn merge <URI_distant_repo/branch> <local_workspace_path/trunk>
```

Branches

- trunk : reference branch
- branches : parallel development
- tags : stable version with a release identifier (tag)

```shell
svn status
svn diff
svn update # detects conflicts
```

Conflict resolution :

- postpone : handle manually later then `svn resolve --accept working <file>`
- diff
- edit directly
- mine-conflict : keep my modifications
- theirs-conflict : keep their modifications

branches :

- by person or feature
- keep them updated
- merges in trunk as team decisions

GL02 project : SourceForge repository

equivalent to git rebase ?
