Part 1: Software

software = programs + documentation
programming -> engineering
lots of components
because software got more complex
complexity: accidental vs essential
            easy       vs hard      to manage

today 50% of software projects still fail
    -> never started (can't get a team, budget, etc)
    -> doesn't meet needs
    -> never completed

software should be:
    - maintainable
    - dependable
    - efficient
    - acceptable (adapted to users' needs)

Part 2: Software engineering process
