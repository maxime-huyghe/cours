# GM02 - CM02 Software Specifications and Requirement Engineering

## Need analysis and software specifications

## What ? Requirement engineering

Data, operation, process, user interface, users' roles...

Sources : interviews, document analysis (existing data), existing standards,
observation, workshops based on prototypes.

Stakes :
- completeness, soundness (everything must be coherent)
- detail and formalization level depending on the reader
- analysis => spec when you write a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) == CDC

### Functionnal vs non-functionnal requirements

"L'art et la mani√®re"

- Functionnal : **what** the software has to enable
- Non-functionnal : **how** it does it (ex: UI, UX, performance, legislation...)

### User vs system requirements

- User/client : needs a simple overview, understandable by all, visuals...
- System : targets people involved in impl/maintenance, fine-grained description, requirements & technical desc

### Why do they change

- Long term : strategy, rules and standards...
- Short term : lots of people will see the doc and understand it differently

## How ? Formalizing elements

### Natural language

- simple description
- most used way
- rather clear and understandable by everyone

but

- can be ambiguous
- not very dense

### Structured language

- using a format
- identifier
- pre/post-conditions
- rationale for the feature
- precise

### Scenario / user stories

Short story about a user doing something with the software including rationale
etc.

- user-centric design
- useful in early stages
- simple & easy

### Mockups

Simple drawings of the UI.

- makes the end system more tangible
- useful for specifying data visualizations
- can have a description

but

- is not self-sufficient


### Diagrams

UML...

### Formal specification

- mathematical models for critical systems
- formal grammars
- abstarct data types

## Specification document (cdc)

### Stakes

- supports dialog between stakeholders
- legal status if smthing goes wrong

### Standard outline

IEEE - 830.
