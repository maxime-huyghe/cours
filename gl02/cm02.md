# GL02 - CM01

## Part 1: Software

software = programs + documentation
programming -> engineering
lots of components
because software got more complex
complexity: accidental vs essential
          ~ easy       vs nigh impossible to reduce

today 50% of software projects still fail
    -> never started (can't get a team, budget, etc)
    -> doesn't meet needs
    -> never completed

software should be:
    - maintainable
    - dependable
    - efficient
    - acceptable (adapted to users' needs)


## Part 2: Software engineering process
    
### Grand modèles qui permettent de s'organiser et de savoir où on en est.

#### Waterfall

set of steps with defined deliverables

requirements ---|
      ^         v
      |       design --|
      |          ^     v
      |          |    impl -----|
      |          |      ^       v
      |          |      |   integration ----|
      |          |      |       ^           v
      |----------|------|-------|------- maintenance

- Easy project mgmt (cost and HR)
- Efficient *if needs are clear*
but
- Overflow between steps in practice
- No flexibility

#### V cycles

Diagram left as an exercise to the reader.

- Easy project mgmt (cost and HR)
- Focus on quality (lots of tests)
but
- Long iteration duration
- No flexibility

#### Incremental development

Concurrency, mid-term delivery.
Addresses interdependancies.

- Follows evolution of needs
but
- Increased complexity of managing project and costs

#### Agile methods

- Tailored to client's needs
- Pragmatic
but
- Scaling to big projects ?
- Client needs to be involved

### Concl

Plan-oriented : Waterfall, V
Needs-oriented : Incremental, Agile

## Part 1: Software project typology and Conclusion

!!! Sommerville, A basic typology

- Stand-alone app (client lourd) : ex mobile
- Interactive transaction based app (client léger) : ex web
- Embedded control system : ex voiture
- Batch system : traite un flux de données
- Entertainment systems : JV, netflix... qlté UX très importante
- Modeling and simulation systems : science, engineering
- Data collection and analysis
- Systems of systems : ex ERP
